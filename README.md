# Face Recognition Attendance System

Welcome to the Face Recognition Attendance System! üì∑‚ú®

This project is a robust attendance system that leverages face recognition technology to mark attendance automatically. It uses Python along with OpenCV and the `face_recognition` library to identify faces. The user interface is built using Tkinter, making it simple and user-friendly.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV for real-time face detection.
- **Face Recognition**: Employs the `face_recognition` library for accurate face matching.
- **User Interface**: Built with Tkinter for easy navigation and operation.
- **Attendance Management**: Automatically marks and records attendance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for the project.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and face detection.
- **face_recognition**: Library for recognizing and manipulating faces.
- **Tkinter**: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tushar-goyal-25/face-recognition-software.git
    cd face-recognition-software
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install face_recognition
    pip install numpy
    pip install pillow
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Application**: Run `main.py` to launch the user interface.
2. **Add Faces**: Use the interface to add faces to the system for recognition.
3. **Mark Attendance**: The system will automatically detect and recognize faces, marking attendance accordingly.
